# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
To create a gamified, aviation-inspired productivity timer where users 'file flight plans' (set tasks) and track their focus sessions as 'flights' on a glassmorphic terminal dashboard.

## Target Audience
- Developers or technical users who enjoy terminal-like interfaces.
- Aviation enthusiasts looking for a thematic productivity tool.
- Users seeking a gamified approach to focus and task management.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Thematic Immersion:** Offers a unique, aviation-inspired environment for productivity, turning mundane task management into an engaging "flight" experience.

## Key Features
- **Flight Plan Input:** A command-line style interface for users to "file flight plans," effectively setting up their tasks and session goals.
- **Radar Tracking:** A visual representation (e.g., a radar sweep or map path) that tracks the progress of the current focus session in real-time.
- **Pilot Logbook:** A historical record of completed "flights," allowing users to review past sessions and track productivity metrics over time.
