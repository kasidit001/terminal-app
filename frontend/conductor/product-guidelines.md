# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic Core:** A fusion of Retro-Futuristic elements (neon accents, scanlines) with a Minimalist & Clean foundation (translucent glassmorphic panels, subtle blurs) and a Tactical & Informative layout.
- **Color Palette:** High-contrast neon accents (greens, ambers, cyans) against dark, semi-transparent backgrounds to evoke a cockpit or terminal display.
- **Typography:** Monospaced fonts for data and terminal inputs to maintain authenticity, balanced with clean sans-serif fonts for general readability.
- **Texture:** subtle scanlines or grain effects to enhance the retro feel without compromising the modern, clean glassmorphism.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Immersion First:** The interface should feel like a specialized tool or instrument panel, maintaining the aviation metaphor throughout interactions.
- **Focus-Driven:** Design elements should minimize distraction during active "flight" sessions, highlighting only critical information like remaining time and current status.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Interactions (button presses, command entries) should feel responsive and deliberate, mimicking the physical switches and controls of an aircraft.
- **Clarity in Complexity:** While the aesthetic is "tactical," information hierarchy must remain clear to prevent cognitive overload.

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional & precise:** The application communicates like a flight computer or air traffic controller—brief, clear, and authoritative.
- **Thematic Terminology:** Use aviation jargon appropriately (e.g., "File Flight Plan" for add task, "Takeoff" for start timer, "Landing" for complete session) to reinforce the theme.
- **Encouraging but Disciplined:** Feedback should be motivating (celebrating a successful "landing") but maintain the disciplined tone of a professional pilot.
